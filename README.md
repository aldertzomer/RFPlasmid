## Abstract

Predicting plasmid contigs from assemblies using single copy marker genes, plasmid genes, kmers
Linda van der Graaf-van Bloois, Jaap Wagenaar, Aldert Zomer

Introduction: 
Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) genes in bacteria are often carried on plasmids. Since
these plasmids can spread the AMR genes between bacteria, it is important to know if the genes
are located on highly transferable plasmids or in the more stable chromosomes. Whole genome
sequence (WGS) analysis makes it easy to determine if a strain contains a resistance gene,
however, it is not easy to determine if the gene is located on the chromosome or on a plasmid as
genome sequence assembly generally results in 50-300 DNA fragments (contigs). With our newly
developed prediction tool, we analyze the composition of these contigs to predict their likely
source, plasmid or chromosomal. This information can be used to determine if a resistant gene is
chromosomally located or on a plasmid. The tool is optimized for 19 different bacterial species,
including Campylobacter, E. coli, and Salmonella, and can also be used for metagenomic
assemblies.

Methods: The tool identifies the number of chromosomal marker genes, plasmid replication genes
and plasmid typing genes using CheckM and DIAMOND Blast, and determines pentamer
frequencies and contig sizes per contig. A prediction model was trained using Random Forest on
an extensive set of plasmids and chromosomes from 19 different bacterial species and validated
on separate test sets of known chromosomal and plasmid contigs of the different bacteria.
Results: Prediction of plasmid contigs was nearly perfect when calculated based on number of
correctly predicted bases, with up to 99% specificity and 99% sensitivity. Prediction of small
contigs remains difficult, since these contigs consists primarily of repeated sequences present in
both plasmid and chromosome, e.g. transposases.

Conclusion: The newly developed tool is able to determine if contigs are chromosomal or plasmid
with a very high specificity and sensitivity (up to 99%) and can be very useful to analyze WGS
data of bacterial genomes and their antimicrobial resistance genes.

## Running RFPlasmid

```
$ rfplasmid --initialize # Only once after installing it. See "Getting the software" below
$ rfplasmid

Error; no arguments. Required to specificy --input and --species
usage: rfplasmid.py [-h] [--species SPECIES] [--input INPUT] [--specieslist] [--jelly] [--out OUT] [--debug] [--training] [--threads THREADS] [--version]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --species SPECIES  define species (required)
  --input INPUT      directory with input fasta files (required)
  --specieslist      list of available species models
  --jelly            run jellyfish as kmer-count (faster)
  --out OUT          specify output directory
  --debug            no cleanup of intermediate files
  --training         trainings mode Random Forest
  --threads THREADS  specify number of threads to be used, default is max available threads up to 16 threads
  --version          print version number

# Example
rfplasmid --species Campylobacter --input inputfolder --jelly --threads 8 --out outputfolder

```
A folder containing .fasta file is required as input.

--jelly requires a functional jellyfish install. Greatly speeds up the analysis. Strongly recommended as our kmer profiling method in Python is slow

Read specieslist.txt or run rfplasmid --specieslist for species specific models. We have a general Enterobacteriaceae model instead of a species model. All others are species except for the "Bacteria" model which can be used for unknown or metagenomics samples.

## Getting the software:

### Using Conda 
thanks to https://github.com/rpetit3. Installs CheckM database as well.
```
$ conda install -c bioconda rfplasmid # or alternatively: conda create -n rfplasmid -c conda-forge -c bioconda rfplasmid ; conda activate rfplasmid
$ rfplasmid --initialize #We makes use of a bash helper script to locate the rfplasmid.py file and to download the plasmid databases as they are too large for conda
$ rfplasmid
```

### Using Pip 
Installs most requirements except DIAMOND and JellyFish and R (see below). You need to download both Prodigal and a database for CheckM if you have never installed it. 

```
$  pip3 install rfplasmid
$  export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin # pip installs in ~/.local/bin and it should be in your path but some distros don't have this set (even though they should).
$  rfplasmid --initialize #We makes use of a bash helper script to locate the rfplasmid.py file and to download the plasmid databases as they are too large for pip
$  rfplasmid
```

### Required if you have never installed CheckM before: 

CheckM relies on a number of precalculated data files which can be downloaded from https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/CheckM_databases/. Decompress the file to an appropriate folder and run the following to inform CheckM of where the files have been placed. The example below uses wget to download the an archive of file and installs them in your homedir.
```
$  sudo apt install hmmer # CheckM needs HMMER. See http://hmmer.org/documentation.html for other methods of downloading and installing it
$  cd ~
$  wget https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal/releases/download/v2.6.3/prodigal.linux
$  cp prodigal.linux ~/bin/prodigal #we assume you have a ~/bin/ folder and it's in your path. 
$  chmod +x ~/bin/prodigal  
$  mkdir .checkm
$  cd .checkm
$  wget https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/CheckM_databases/checkm_data_2015_01_16.tar.gz
$  tar xzvf checkm_data_2015_01_16.tar.gz
$  checkm data setRoot ~/.checkm
```

### Dependencies you need to install when installing RFPlasmid using Pip

## Training your own model

RFPlasmid comes with an option to train your own model if you provide it with contigs of chromosomes and plasmids. The following steps will generate the model for you and make it available for your RFplasmid installation. We will use the genus Lactococcus as an example.

The following steps need to be taken.
1. Get and install RFPlasmid from Github
2. Prepare a folder containing your plasmid contigs and your chromosome contigs. Draft genome assemblies are highly recommended, don't use completed genomes, as the genomes you want to analyze also won't be complete. Make sure that the plasmid contig file(s) start with "p" and the file(s) with the chromosomal contigs start with "c". In the example they are called plasmids.fasta and chromosomes.fasta, but as long as the files start with p or c your are good. They may also be separate files per genome/plasmid. You need about 20 plasmids and 20 chromosomes for a decent classification.
3. Add the name of your genus/family/etc to specieslist.txt. Use the name exactly as it is listed in CheckM for the appropriate taxon level. It is not recommended to use a species level model, else you will have to deal with spaces in names. Use only genus level or higher. 
4. Run RFplasmid in training mode. If you have very large numbers of contigs (>5000) it is recommended to adjust the sampsize option in the training.R script (change it to e.g. 1000, at most to 2/3rds of the smallest number of contigs per class).
5. Move the resulting training.rfo R object in the output folder to the RFplasmid folder and name it appropriately 
6. Test your new plasmid prediction model

Below an example of the commands. Replace Lactococcus with the genus of interest and ofcourse change "/mnt/data/files" to the folder containing the input
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aldertzomer/RFPlasmid.git
$ cd RFPlasmid
$ bash getdb.sh
$ mkdir Lactococcus
$ cat /mnt/data/files/p*.fasta > Lactococcus/plasmids.fasta
$ cat /mnt/data/files/c*.fasta > Lactococcus/chromosomes.fasta
$ checkm taxon_list |grep Lactococcus
$ echo "Lactococcus genus" >> specieslist.txt # this is important. Don't skip this step.
$ python3 rfplasmid.py --training --jelly --input Lactococcus --threads 16 --out Lactococcus.out --species Lactococcus
$ cp Lactococcus.out/training.rfo Lactococcus.rfo
```

It is recommended to load the object in R and explore it to check how well it performs using the OOB output and the confusion matrix. Generally you want to have the number of chromosome contigs that are predicted as being plasmid contigs as low as possible. It is also recommended to check the sizes of the contigs that are incorrectly predicted, as contigs <1 kb are more difficult to predict and at some point no improvements are possible. Modifying the ratio of the contigs sampled in the sampsize option in the training.R script may push the values to more chromosomal or plasmid contigs correctly predicted. In all our models the ratio was kept 1:1. 

```
$ R
> library(randomForest)
> load("Lactococcus.rfo")
> rf
```


Test your model using 

```
python3 rfplasmid.py --jelly --input Lactococcus --threads 16 --out Lactococcus.out2 --species Lactococcus
```
